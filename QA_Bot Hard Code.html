        answer: "Reasons for a missing account: Registration Failure, Incorrect Username, Incorrect Credentials. 1) All mandatory fields must be completed before a registration is successfully completed. If there are uncompleted or incorrect fields the registration for will remain visible for correction to be made. Once a Resident has successfully completed their registration they will be forwarded to their Resident Portal. 2) If a Resident failed to use their KDOC ID Number as their username their account may have been deleted. If this is the case they will need to re-enter their information into the system, this time using their KDOC ID# as their username. 3) To access the system the Resident needs to login with the username and pin they registered with. Their password can be updated from the Administration screen by locating the resident, clicking on edit, then click on view linked user account (located on the far right), on the next screen you'll need to scroll down to Set New Password. If the password is rated as 'Very Weak' check the 'Confirm use of weak password' and save the record."
